# Thesis: Yelp Sucks (and isn't personal enough)

  ## Why?
  - Search results are biased due to their business model 
  - Data overload (returns way more restaurants than you actually need)
  - Doesn't actually help you find (new) places efficiently
  - Who cares about reviews from 5 years ago?

  ## Goal:
  - Create a prototype for a Yelp alternative centered around urban, walking environments
  - Leverage infinite scroll and "gesture" swiping features found in other app domains (i.e. dating apps etc.)
  - Suggest restaurants based on the user's location
  - Suggest new restaurants over time based on user's "liked" restaurants
